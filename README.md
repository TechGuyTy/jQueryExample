# jQueryExample

This is a sample project in order to get more experience with jQuery. Currently the only jQuery included is when the first thing is clicked.
After this button is clicked, it changes the inner CSS of the first-heading element to green. Have fun by finding different animations 
and other jQuery elements you can add!
